Step 2 : configure system
C#R1
config
interface fastEthernet 0/0
ip address 192.168.1.50 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
interface serial 0/0
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
C#PC1

show ip
(optional) R2#ping 192.168.2.1
C#R3
config t
interface fastEthernet 0/0
ip address 192.168.3.50 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
interface serial 0/0

C#PC3
ip 192.168.3.1/24 192.168.3.50
show ip
(optional)R3#ping 192.168.3.1

Step 3 : Configure and test ACL 
C#R1
config t
router rip
version 2
network 192.168.1.0
network 10.0.0.0
exit
exit
wr
C#R2
config t
router rip
version 2
network 192.168.2.0
network 11.0.0.0
exit
exit
wr
C#R3
config t
router rip
version 2
network 192.168.3.0
network 11.0.0.0
(test) ping 192.168.1.1

Step 4 : Apply Standard ACL

# Here the scenario we are going to use is that whatever data that is being sent by PC 1
should not be received by PC 3, so based on the features of a standard ACL, we know
that it needs to be placed near the destination.
# So by checking the network topology we can say that the best place to create a
standard ACL is in Router 3. We should also note that the number of the standard
ACL should be in the range of 1-99, in our case we have chosen 10.

C#R3
config t
access-list 10 deny host 192.168.1.1
exit
show access-list
config t
access-list 10 permit any
interface serial 0/0
ip acces-group 10 in
exit
exit
wr

###
PC1 tries to send to PC3, its access is denied
PC1>ping 192.168.3.1
But when PC2 tries to send data to PC3, its allowed
PC2>ping 192.168.3.1

###- To remove any acl configuration = In config mode no access-list <access-list-number> ###

Step 5 : External ACL

# Here the scenario we are going to use is that PC 2 should not be able to send data to
PC 3. To achieve this we are going to use External ACL.
# The concept of external ACL states that we need to place it close to its source. So in
terms of the network topology and the position of PC 2, the closest place that is near
the source would be Router 2 .
# We should also note that the number of the external ACL should be in the range of
100-199, in our case we have chosen 141.

C#R2
config t
access-list 141 deny icmp host 192.168.2.1 host 192.168.3.1
access-list 141 permit icmp any any
do show access-list
interface serial 0/1
ip access-group 141 out
exit
exit

###Here below, we can observe that when PC 2 tries to send data to PC 3, its access is
denied.
PC2>ping 192.168.3.1
###Similarly when PC 3 tries to send data to PC 2, nothing gets through since all
communication has been blocked between them.
PC3>ping 192.168.2.1
###But when PC 1 tries to send data to PC 2, its access is not denied.
PC1>ping 192.168.2.1
